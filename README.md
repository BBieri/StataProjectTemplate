# StataProjectTemplate

This is a simple Stata project template that can be used to set up the
basic file structure of a data science project. Here are a few things
to note before starting:

### Notes
- The project contains a Master do-file which calls the relevant sub-dofiles
that are more project oriented.
- The do-file is carefully commmented and should guide you when replicating
the analysis.
- The .gitignore file prevents raw data from being uploaded to GitHub. This ensures
the safety of the data.
- Note the sysinfo of the machine/configuration with which **all** elements
of the analysis were run in this README.
